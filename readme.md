# learning-javascript

A personal learning workspace containing small JavaScript examples and exercises organized by topic. Each folder contains bite-sized demos meant for experimenting in the browser and practicing core JavaScript concepts.

## Purpose

This repository is a hands-on collection of examples covering DOM events, async programming, ES6 features, array helpers, loops, OOP basics, and small animations using GSAP — designed for incremental learning and quick experimentation.

## Quick start

- Clone or open the workspace in your editor.
- Most examples are plain HTML/JS; open the folder you want and open the `index.html` (or the highlighted HTML file) in your browser.
- Example: open [events/index.html](events/index.html) to try the feedback form demo.

## Notable folders

- `events` — DOM events and a feedback form example.
- `async programming` — promises, async/await, and callbacks examples.
- `gsap` / `gsap learning` — small animation demos using GSAP.
- `destructuring`, `spread operator`, `template strings` — focused ES6 feature examples.
- `for of loop`, `for in loop`, `controlflow-conditional-statements` — loop and control-flow practice.

Explore other folders for many short, focused examples used while learning JavaScript.

## Tips

- Use the browser DevTools console to inspect behavior and experiment with variables.
- If a script reads input values too early, move `.value` reads inside the event handler so values are captured at submit time.
